I have been a professional developer since 2015 after graduating with a CS degree from [Exia.Cesi](https://exia.cesi.fr/). I develop mostly in C#, C++ and Go but I know about Java CE/EE/Card/RT too. (And other web-related tech.)

I write some stuff time to time, when I have the time on my github.

When I’m not coding, I’m spending time doing (french) pastry or dreaming, I like cooperative gaming.
