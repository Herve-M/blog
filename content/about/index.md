Welcome to "N(H)erve’d Powered Chronicles!" I’m Hervé-M a software engineer turned principal software architect manager, with experience spanning from Luxembourg, Austria, Canada to currently Vietnam. My journey began with studies at Exia.Cesi University in France and UQAM in Canada, and has since evolved into a deep passion for crafting software.

I’ve worn many hats, from DevOps Advocate to polyglot developer, working with C#/.NET, Golang, C++, and Java _(CE/EE/Card/RT)_. My approach to development is grounded in high standards, where discipline, code beauty, and architectural correctness reign supreme—5S methodology could very well be my favorite motto.

Through this blog, I’m sharing my adventures in tech, from the triumphs to the inevitable challenges.

## Why `nherve`?

 `N(H)erve` is a clever _(I believe at least)_ blend of `nerved` and `Herve` which sounds like `n-herve`/`n-rv` in French, leading to the word "énervé"—the French equivalent of 'nerved' in English, meaning both excited and irritated. It’s a playful reference to the emotional rollercoaster coding often brings! The name captures the tension between energy and frustration, making it the perfect fit for a blog about tech, code, and the adventures (or misadventures) that come with it. It reflects both the challenges and the fun of my personal and profesional journey.
