## Context

A Product Team, composed of two sub-teams (~6 people each) were using MsTeams over last 6 years as main way of communication for differents roles and flows per teams.

- Team's channels duplication
- Onboarding difficulties for newcomer and/or reteaming
  - Access right not given or missing
  - No offical list of channel to be given access per role

## Learned

### `Chat by default` behavior is our enemy

Many people tends to forget that knowlege over a whole Product doesn't stop at the main wiki and PBI, which are often not good enough, asking and sharing business or technical related answer should always be towards the Team for the Team.  
From now on, we should advocate that question related to Business or general Technical point should be addressed in a public `Ask me anything` channel allowing long term Q&A inside MsTeams.

### `Shared` channel are offen not known

Before Micrososft MsTeams allowed shared channel, it was really "raw" to create space for support between internal or extern teams. One common solution is create a second MsTeams Team, full of private channel limited by scope or team.  
From now on, creating a shared channel do the trick of limiting access but still having the whole team aware and being able to be proactive.  

### Per project channel need a process

Per project channel or " temporary"  channel tends to end into the shadow of ddarkness and be forgotten, to be only revided by an newcomer which thought that the confusing naming was correct.  
From now on, each temporary channel will be indentifiable like `[Project]` and the one who create has the sole responsability to manage and close it.  

### Communication tools are often forgotten reponsabilities

Onboarding plan include by default, business and technical sharing, maybe Team processes like Scrum or other but most team forgot to document the "commucation flow" part about where, how and what.  
From now on, each manager role and role needing dedicated channel (or flow) have to maintain the onboarding documentation as for taking responsabilities of maintaining access right.

### Someone need to be police man

Human tends to forget, imaginly adapt and even correct the trueth for their own work, making little derivation that might end into chaos.  
From now on at least a member of the Prodcut Team should be, as for time keeper in meeting; a "police man" which maintain, challenge and enforce update of onboarding material as MsTeams structure sanity.
